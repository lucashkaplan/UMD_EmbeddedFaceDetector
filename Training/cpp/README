Source code for training algorithm

To compile and run use makeme and runme. Outputs config_x.txt files corresponding to each stage in the cascade. Pulls training files from ../Dataset/test/txt/ or from ../Dataset/full/txt, and validation files from ../Dataset/validate/txt

training.cpp contains main, 
calc_features.cpp contains feature calculation method,
stage.cpp contains training functions,
validate.cpp contains output function for printing config files,
data.h contains all data structures used
