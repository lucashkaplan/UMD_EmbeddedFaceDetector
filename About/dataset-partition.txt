Images for full training in ./Training/Dataset/full/txt .
Images for testing training program in ./Training/Dataset/test/txt/

The test training files are a subset of the full training dataset used for 
debugging the training program. The validation images are a partition of 
the full dataset (seperate from training dataset) used to validate the training results, for use in the EFDS and the training program.
