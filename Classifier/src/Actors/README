Actors

imgRead
inputs: filesystem::path inputImgFile (path to input image)
outputs: welt_c_fifo_pointer output_IIS (pointer to an IIS)
Description: This actor takes in a path to an input image and outputs a ptr. to an IIS 
containing the index of this image and its contents.

classifier:
    The classifier actor uses a config file to load in weak classifier parameters.
    The format of this config file is as follows.
	The first line contains an id for the strong classifier. The second line contains one integer, the number
    of weak classifiers that makes up the strong classifier.
    There are then that many lines containing the feature type, x y coordinate of the top left
    corner of the feature, width, height, parity, threshold and alpha.

    config.txt:
	<id>
    <count>
    <type> <x> <y> <width> <height> <p> <thresh> <alpha>
    <type> <x> <y> <width> <height> <p> <thresh> <alpha>
    ...
inputs: input image FIFO, name of config file
outptus: continue FIFO,  abort FIFO
description: Determines whether a face is present or not in an image by
calculating the feature values of the features provided in the config
file. These feature values are applied to a strong classifer formulation
which determine whether there is a face or not. If there is the IIS is
passed along on the continue FIFO. If not, if is sent to the abort FIFO.


file sink:
inputs: abort fifo and face fifo, name of output file
outputs: Data to output file
desctiption: This actor checks which FIFO contains a token.
If it is the abort fifo, the image index along with "NF" is 
written to the output file. Otherwise the image index and
"F" is written to the output file.
