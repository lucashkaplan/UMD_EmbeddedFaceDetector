face_detector graph
This graph implements all fo the actors to create a fully functioning EFDS.
The graph is built to be configurable in the number of strong classifiers and thus the number of actors it contains. Each iteration classifies one image in the input directory. 

All config files fed to the graph are assumed to have the format of:

config<id>.txt 

where id is the index of the strong classifier, starting at 1.

inputs: count of strong classifiers, input image directory, output file name

outputs: output file with each image idnex and corresponding classification,
diagnostics.txt with information on the run.
